Netlify can not find my page, after I deploy my code from github. I tried it a couple of times, but I do not know how? About the coding I had troubles with the header, I think I made it difficult for me to rearrange the elements in my header, because I created my own logo. I missed the last class on friday because I was in a flight to the other side of the world and for my feeling i missed a lot. Now in this project this were the struggles but I learned a lot of coding including the games I noticed that when I was typing the answers that I automatically pushed ctrl S.

i asked for tech-support
